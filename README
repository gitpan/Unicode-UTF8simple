Unicode::UTF8simple - Conversions to/from UTF8 from/to charactersets

This utf-8 converter is written in plain perl and works with hopefully
any perl 5 version. It was mainly written because more recent modules
such as Encode do not work under older Perl 5.0 installations.

Supported encodings:
    euc-kr
    gb2312
    iso-8859-1
    iso-8859-2
    iso-8859-9
    koi8-r
    utf-8
    windows-1256

See the file test.pl for examples on how to use the module.

Installation:
-------------
To install run:
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Non-standard Installation:
--------------------------
If you want to install UTF8simple 
below /usr/local ( /usr/local/lib/5.6.0/i386-linux etc...)
then run
perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local
make
make test
make install

To install only the perl module in a different location
(but e.g. the man pages in the standard location) use:

perl Makefile.PL LIB=/you/new/libpath
make test
make install
